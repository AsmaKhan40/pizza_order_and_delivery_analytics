🍕 Pizza Delivery Data Analysis Project

End-to-end pizza delivery analysis using SQL (cleaning), Python (EDA), and Power BI (interactive dashboard). Includes PPT with insights.


📌Project Overview:-
This project focuses on analyzing Pizza Delivery Data to uncover key insights related to order patterns, delays, customer preferences, and delivery performance.
It includes data cleaning using SQL, Python used for EDA & Analyzing , and an interactive Power BI dashboard for business decision-making.

🛠️ Tech Stack
SQL – Data storing, data cleaning and transformation
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Analyzing and visualizations
Power BI – Interactive dashboard for insights

📊 Key Insights

Non-Veg pizzas have the highest delay rates, followed by Veg and Cheese Burst pizzas.
Weekends experience the most delays compared to weekdays.
Peak order times are around 6 PM to 8 PM.
Specialty pizzas like Thin Crust and Deep Dish have minimal delays, likely due to lower demand.
The monthly delay trends showed that August experienced the highest number of delays, likely due to a peak in orders during that month.

🔄 My Workflow

Collected Data:- Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle as a CSV file.
Stored and Cleaned the Data:- Imported the data into MySQL. Cleaned it using SQL (handled missing values, removed duplicates, fixed data types).
Explored the Data with Python:- Analyzed key trends and created visualizations for better understanding.Built the Dashboard,Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs, slicers, and multiple charts.
Documented Everything:- Summarized the findings and actionable recommendations in a PowerPoint presentation.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Enhanced Pizza Data
Description: The dataset contains pizza order details, including order ID, date, pizza type, size, delay, location, etc.

📝 Actionable Insights

Focus on improving delivery efficiency for pizzas that often face delays, like Non-Veg pizzas, to keep customers happy.
Plan for extra staff during peak months such as August, when orders are at their highest.
Make arrangements of resources in each location according to the pizzas that are commonly ordered there.
Run promotional offers or discounts during months with fewer orders, like July, to increase sales.

📌 Future Improvements

Add predictive analytics using machine learning to forecast sales.
Incorporate real-time data for live dashboard updates.
